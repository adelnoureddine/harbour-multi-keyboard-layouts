1- Improved layouts (for English, English Azerty, French and Arabic/العربية):
- Number row
- Wider space button
- Emojis on 2nd/3rd pages
- Arrow keys (right/left) on 2nd/3rd pages
- Popup symbols on the layout
- Standard layouts similar to iOS/Android

2- Layouts with a number row: English, English Azerty, French, Arabic (العربية), German (Deutsch), Dutch (thanks to aerique), and Belgisch (thanks to ruditimmermans)

The new keyboard layouts should work automatically after installation (you can choose them from Settings). However, if a layout doesn't show up, try one of the following options : 1) restart the device, 2) use Sailfish Utilities to restart Home Screen using Sailfish Utilities, or 3) from the terminal in developer mode, login as root (devel-su), then type : killall maliit-server
